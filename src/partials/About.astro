		<p>
			To constantly improve my knowledge, learn new ideas and perfecting my tools is something that certanly rings true to me. Having all the knowledge that I need to be able to create basically anything I want is my biggest motivation.

			And, when Iâ€™m not coding websites or making games, I love getting outdoors, grabbing a beer with some friends or just play some games.
